## Use Case
In a service oriented architecture, an existing challenge is to manage running binaries, dependencies and networking. **Orchestra**'s goal is to provide a unique place where you can *run*, *stop*, *aggregate logs* and *config* your Go binaries.

## Goals
- **Standalone**: The first requirement is to provide support as a standalone tool, without external dependencies (apart from *docker* when using vendors). An optional flag will be provided to run the Go binaries inside a docker container.
- **Rerun**: Reload (build, test and run) services upon modification
- **Vendors**: Specify dependecies with existing services. Vendor software (e.g. postgres, rabbitmq, etc) will run inside Docker. This feature relies on `crane`.
- **Configuration**: A global configuration file will be required to specify `ENV` variables for every service. An optional configuration file can be specified
- **Testing**: Run unit tests and acceptance tests.
- **Logging**: Show aggregated logs for every service in the fleet.
- **Reliability**: Services started with Orchestra should operate atomically and in a reliable way. When Orchestra starts a service should check for the running processes, and match and kill services running outside this toolkit (e.g. running `go run main.go` inside a service folder or the `./service` binary)
- **Scale**: Services should be able to scale, by default the scale level is set to 1. A scale value can be set for every service inside their configuration file.

## Command Line Cmd/Flags Proposal
- `start`
    - *rerun*: uses rerun to run the services
    - *scale*: overwrites the defined scale parameter
- `stop`
- `restart`
- `vendors`
- `logs`
- `ps`

## Design Proposal
- The application will create a `.orchestra` folder in the directory (inside the `GOPATH`) that we want to orchestrate. The purpose of this directoy is to provide the necessary context when running orchestra again.
- The application can be run in every folder inside the `GOPATH`, e.g. let's assume that we have a single repo (called `myservices`) with all the services in different folders, you can run orchestra inside that folder and it will recursively (with `depth=1`) look in every directory for a configuration file (i.e. `service.yml`) and register the services. This approach works seamlessly with services split in multiple repositories in one GitHub account.
- Logging is extremely important, and with great logging comes great responsibilities. For simplicity we'll redirect the output of a service into a file, then we use `github.com/ActiveState/tail` library to aggregate the logs of different services, maybe make them colorful and prefix them with the service name.
- Code reload of Go binaries can be achieved using `github.com/skelterjohn/rerun`. It relies on `fsnotify` and it watches for changes in the Go files. It can be possible, before every run, to run the tests again using `go test`. I am considering of forking the project for the sake of better logging.
- The application is a pure command-line toolkit, for this reason we may need commands, maybe subcommands and flags. For simplicity I intend to use the well known `github.com/urfave/cli` library.
- `YAML` will be used as the standard format to store configuration files. In Go, a YAML parser is required, `github.com/go-yaml/yaml` is my favorite option at the moment to marshal or unmarshal files.
- An initialization process may be used to initialize a folder as an orchestra project. This may be a useful step to do some checks before start looking into all subdirectories and start running the binaries.
